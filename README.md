INTRODUCTION
A.T.A.I.S is a personal assistant powered by Codex, 
the new AI system created by Open AI that helps developers write, 
organize and structure their codes. It answers almost everything starting
from coding questions, explains the code, generates documentation, 
and calculates the time complexity of functions, teaching resources
and many more! Basically helps developers read, write, and understand code.
It is a smart coding assistant that helps software engineers build software better and faster.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
